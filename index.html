Duty comes first, and I don’t have time for pleasantries. My life revolves around eliminating the Titans, protecting humanity, and making sure my squad operates at peak efficiency. I’ve seen enough loss to understand that strength is the only way forward. Cleanliness is a necessity, not a preference—order in the world begins with order in the small things. If you don’t pull your weight, you won’t last long by my side. That’s a promise, not a threat.</p><div class="icons"><a href="https://github.com/Ashwaatthaamaaa" target="_blank"><i class="devicon-github-original colored"></i></a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarthak-kumar-b976aa153?utm_source=share&utm_campaign=share_via&utm_content=profile&utm_medium=android_app" target="_blank"><i class="devicon-linkedin-plain"></i></a> <a href="https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/Levi_Ackerman" target="_blank"><span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi-external-link"></span></a></div></div></div></header><main><h1>My Squad*</h1><div class="grids"><div class="grid"><div class="image"><img src="" alt="" id="eren"></div><div class="description"><div class="title"><h2>Eren Yeager</h2><a href="https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/Eren_Yeager" target="_blank"><span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi-external-link"></span></a></div><p>Eren is a reckless idiot with more raw power than sense. He’s got this burning desire for freedom that clouds his judgment, constantly rushing into things without thinking. His potential is undeniable, but if he doesn’t learn to control his rage and stop acting like a lone wolf, he’ll get himself—and others—killed.</p></div></div><div class="grid"><div class="image"><img id="mikasa"></div><div class="description"><div class="title"><h2>Mikasa</h2><a href="https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/Mikasa_Ackerman" target="_blank"><span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi-external-link"></span></a></div><p>Mikasa is a force of nature—quiet, precise, and deadly in combat. She’s one of the most reliable soldiers I’ve got, but her loyalty to Eren blinds her. She’d throw herself into any fire for him without a second thought. If she ever learned to fight for herself instead of just protecting him, she’d be unstoppable.</p></div></div><div class="grid"><div class="image"><img src="" alt="" id="armin"></div><div class="description"><div class="title"><h2>Armin</h2><a href="https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/Armin_Arlert" target="_blank"><span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi-external-link"></span></a></div><p>Armin’s not built for the front lines, but his mind is a weapon of its own. He’s the strategist, always thinking three steps ahead when the rest of us are barely keeping up. He’s hesitant, doubts himself too much, but when push comes to shove, Armin’s the one who’ll find a way out of any impossible situation.</p></div></div><div class="grid"><div class="image"><img src="" alt="" id="jean"></div><div class="description"><div class="title"><h2>Jean</h2><a href="https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/Jean_Kirstein" target="_blank"><span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi-external-link"></span></a></div><p>Jean’s a realist—he doesn’t pretend to be a hero, and that’s what makes him effective. He’s got good instincts, a sharp tongue, and enough sense to know when to step back. At first, he seemed like just another selfish soldier, but over time, he’s proven he’ll step up when it matters. He’s got leadership potential, even if he doubts it himself.</p></div></div><div class="grid"><div class="image"><img src="" alt="" id="connie"></div><div class="description"><div class="title"><h2>Connie</h2><a href="https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/Connie_Springer" target="_blank"><span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi-external-link"></span></a></div><p>Connie’s got a good heart, but he’s not the brightest. He’s quick on his feet, both in battle and in making jokes, but sometimes he doesn’t grasp the gravity of things right away. Still, his loyalty to his friends and his determination to protect them make him dependable when it counts. He’s not a natural leader, but he’ll always have your back.</p></div></div><div class="grid"><div class="image"><img src="" alt="" id="sasha"></div><div class="description"><div class="title"><h2>Sasha</h2><a href="https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/Sasha_Blouse" target="_blank"><span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi-external-link"></span></a></div><p>Sasha’s instincts are sharp, especially with a bow in her hands. She’s got an oddball personality—always thinking about food, even in the worst situations—but don’t let that fool you. When it’s time to fight, she’s as focused and fearless as they come. Her sense of humor lightens the load, and despite her quirks, she’s one of the most dependable soldiers on the field.</p></div></div></div></main><footer><div class="contact"><h2>Contact me</h2><p>Due to the nature of my work, I prefer to keep communication brief.
